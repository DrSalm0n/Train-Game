#"Crazy Train"

#Description

You must calculate the speed it requires to stop right at the station and win points by doing so, the more close they are to the center of the station the more points you win.
There is limited coal for the player to use, if the player runs out of coal the game ends, and the player refills the coal each time they reach a station.
There are also obstacles like animals that will reduce the speed drastically if being hit, so the player must use the whistle to scare them; to use the whistle 
the player will have to press the keys in the order they appear on the middle of the screen, when these keys appear on the screen it means an obstacle is about to appear.
